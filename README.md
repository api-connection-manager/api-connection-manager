##Wordpress API Connection Manager

The API Connection Manager provides an API for developers to easily access 
third party resources, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter etc.

All third party keys and credentials are managed from the one settings page, so
there is no more need to have a settings page for each individual plugin.

Service can be activated, deactivated and installed/removed.
